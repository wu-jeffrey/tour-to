# Introduction

This is a coding challenge for a frontend developer position at [Argo](https://www.rideargo.com/). The challenge is to create a simple web application that allows users to plan a tour to some popular Toronto landmarks. Read the full project spec [here](https://github.com/wu-jeffrey/tour-to/wiki/0-Project-Specifications).

## Quickstart ðŸš€
I added some quick commands to get you up and running!
```bash
sh setup.sh && npm run quickstart
```

## All available commands ðŸ“œ
### `npm run quickstart`
installs all npm dependencies and starts the server and client concurrently

### `npm start`
starts the server and client concurrently

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run server`
starts the server only

### `npm run client`
starts the client only

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run deploy`
deploys the client and server to firebase and google cloud run respectively (You'll need to have access to the firebase and google cloud run projects)

### `npm run deploy:client`

Walk through this one-way door if you like dealing with webpack :)
